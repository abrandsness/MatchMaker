# MatchMaker
This is a group project for Database Management at Whitworth University

Data was gathered from a google questionnaire, and then uploaded to MySQL. Then, functions written in Python pulled the data in and put them into People and Question classes.  Each person is compared with every other person and their answers to each question are compared to calculate a match score.  The top three matches for each person are compiled and put into an email that describes the three matches, their bios, and three random questions that the pair matched on.

The questions and answers for this survey are silly, and are not meant to produce any meaningful matches, but just to demonstrate the use of MySQL and embedded SQL.
